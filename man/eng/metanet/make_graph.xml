  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>make_graph</VERB> makes a graph list according to its arguments which are
    respectively the name of the graph, a flag for directed or undirected, the
    number of nodes and the row vectors tail and head. These are the minimal data
    needed for a graph.</P>
    <P>
    If <VERB>n</VERB> is a positive number, graph <VERB>g</VERB> has <VERB>n</VERB> nodes; this
    number must be greater than or equal to <VERB>max(max(tail),max(head))</VERB>. If
    it is greater than this number,graph <VERB>g</VERB> has isolated nodes. 
    The nodes names are taken as the nodes numbers.</P>
    <P>
    If <VERB>n</VERB> is equal to 0, graph <VERB>g</VERB> has no isolated node and the number
    of nodes is computed from <VERB>tail</VERB> and <VERB>head</VERB>. The nodes names are
    taken from the numbers in <VERB>tail</VERB> and <VERB>head</VERB>.</P>
