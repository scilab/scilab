  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_a">Matlab addition emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
   
    <P>Matlab and Scilab addition behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

        <SP>
        With character string operands: The <VERB>+</VERB> 
        operator is used into Scilab to catenate character strings, while
        Matlab realizes the sum of the operands ASCII codes.
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	With empty matrix: In Scilab, if one of the
      	operands is an empty matrix the result of the addition is the
      	other operand. In Matlab if one of the operand is an empty
      	matrix the result of the addition should be an error or an empty
      	matrix.

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_a(A,B)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>A+B</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_a</VERB> calls:

	If <VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> are character strings, 
	<VERB>mtlb_a(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>asciimat(A)+asciimat(B)</VERB>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	If both <VERB>A</VERB> and <VERB>B</VERB> are not empty matrices
	<VERB>mtlb_a(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>A+B</VERB>,
	else <VERB>mtlb_a(A,B)</VERB> may be replaced by

	If mtlb_mode==%T, then <VERB>mtlb_a(A,B)</VERB>
