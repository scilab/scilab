  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>The Param3d entity is a leaf of the graphics entities hierarchy.</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>visible</VERB> property value for
        the entity . It should be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB> .
        By default, the curves are visibles, the value's property is
        <VERB>"on" </VERB>. If <VERB>"off"</VERB> the curves are not drawn on
        the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
        <SP>This field contains the coordinates of the 3d curves. it is the
        matrix <VERB>[X,Y,Z]</VERB> such as <VERB>X(:,i)</VERB>,
        <VERB>Y(:,i)</VERB>, <VERB>Z(:,i)</VERB> contain the 3D coordinates of
        the <VERB>i</VERB>'th curve. This field contains the default
        <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value for Segs, Arcs, Rectangle and
        Polyline objects.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>line_mode</VERB> property
        value for the polyline. Its value should be <VERB>"on" </VERB>(line
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no line drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
        <SP>This field selects the type of line to be used to draw lines . Its
        value should be an integer in [0 6]. 0 stands for solid, the other
        values stand for a selection of dashes (see
        <LINK>getlinestyle</LINK>).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="polyline_style: ">
        <SP>This field selects the way curve are drawn: interpolated
        (default), staircase, barplot, arrowed and filled modes are available
        through integer index [1:5].</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property
        value. Its value should be <VERB>"on"</VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB>
        (default value).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_style: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_style</VERB> property
        value. The <VERB>mark_style</VERB> selects the type of mark to be
        displayed. Its value should be an integer in [0 9] which stands for:
        dot, plus, cross, star, filled diamond, diamond, triangle up, triangle
        down, trefle and circle.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size_unit: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB>
        property value. If <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"point"</VERB>, then the <VERB>mark_size</VERB> value is
        directly given in points. When <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"tabulated"</VERB>, <VERB>mark_size</VERB> is computed relative
        to the font size array: therefore, its value should be an integer in
        [0 5] whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt. Note that
        <LINK>param3d</LINK> and pure scilab functions use
        <VERB>tabulated</VERB> mode as default ; when using <LINK>plot</LINK>
        function, the <VERB>point</VERB> mode is automatically enabled.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_size</VERB> property
        value</SP>

        <SP>. The <VERB>mark_size</VERB> selects the font size of the mark to
        be displayed. Its value should be an integer in [0 5] whith stands for
        8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt (see <LINK>getmark</LINK>).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_foreground</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' edge color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_background: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_background</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' face color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>thickness</VERB> value of
        the lines used to draw the axes and the curves. It should be a
        positive integer.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the color index used to draw the curves. Its

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"off"</VERB> this means that all curves created after
            that are not clipped (default value).</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"clipgrf"</VERB> this means that all curves created
            after that are clipped outside the Axes boundaries.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"on"</VERB> this means that all curves created after
            that are clipped outside the rectangle given by property
            clip_box.</SP>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>clip_box</VERB> property
        value. Its value should be an empty matrix if clip_state is
        <VERB>"off"</VERB>. Other case the clipping is given by the vector
        <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point width height).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="user_data: ">
	<SP>This field can be use to store any scilab variable in the
	  param3d data structure, and to retreive it.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This property contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the
        3D curves entity should be of type <VERB>"Axes"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"Compound"</VERB>.</SP>
