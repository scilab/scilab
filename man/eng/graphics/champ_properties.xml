  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="champ_properties">description of the 2D vector
  field entity properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>The Champ entity is a leaf of the graphics entities hierarchy. This
    entity defines the parameters for a 2D vector field.</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This properties contains the <VERB>visible</VERB> property value
        for the entity . It should be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB>
        . If <VERB>"on" </VERB> the vector field is drawn, If
        <VERB>"off"</VERB> the vector field is not displayed on the
        screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="data: ">
        <SP>This field defines a <VERB>tlist</VERB> data structure of type
        <VERB>"champdata"</VERB> composed of a row and column indices of each
        element : the x and y grid coordinates are contained respectively in
        <VERB>data.x </VERB>and <VERB>data.y</VERB>. The complementary fields
        named <VERB>data.fx</VERB> and <VERB>data.fy</VERB> are matrices which
        describe respectively the <VERB>x</VERB> and <VERB>y</VERB> component
        of the vector field at point <VERB>(x(i),y(j))</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="user_data: ">
	<SP>This field can be use to store any scilab variable in the
	  champ data structure, and to retreive it.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value should be an integer in
        [0 9]. 0 stands for solid the other value stands for a selection of
        dashes. This property applies to all lines used to draw the vector
        field.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This property contains the <VERB>thickness</VERB> property for all
        lines used to draw the vector field. Its value should be a non
        negative integer..</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="colored: ">
        <SP>If this this property value is <VERB>"on"</VERB>, fields vectors
        are drawn using a color proportional to the intensity of the
        field.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_state: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value for
        the champ. It should be :</SP>

        <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <P><VERB>"off"</VERB> this means that the vector field is not
            clipped</P>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <P><VERB>"clipgrf"</VERB> this means that the vector field is
            clipped outside the Axes box.</P>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <P><VERB>"on"</VERB> this means that the vector field is clipped
            outside the rectangle given by property clip_box.</P>
          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
        </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_box: ">
        <SP>This property contains the <VERB>clip_box</VERB> property. Its
        value should be an empty matrix if clip_state is "off" .Other cases
        the vector <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point width height)
        defines the portions of the vector field to display, however
        <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value will be changed.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This property contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the
        2D vector field entity should be of the type <VERB>"Axes"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"Compound"</VERB>.</SP>
