  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    This function computes an approximated cubic spline <EM>s</EM> for the datas 
    <VERB>xd, yd, wd</VERB> (in the following <EM>m</EM> is supposed to be the 
    length of these vectors) and from a choice of the spline breakpoints <VERB>x</VERB> 
    (for instance if you want n breakpoints uniformly choosen you may use 
    <TT>x=linspace(min(xd),max(xd),n))</TT>). If <EM>S</EM> is the space of all
    cubic splines functions with breakpoints <EM>x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn</EM> then 
    the resulting spline <EM>s</EM> is such that:

     <P> for all <EM>f in S</EM>, i.e. realizes the minimum of the sum of the squared errors

    The spline <EM>s</EM> is completly defined by the triplet <VERB>(x,y,d)</VERB> 
    (<VERB>y</VERB> and <VERB>d</VERB> are the vectors of the spline ordinates and
    first derivatives at the xi 's : <EM>yi=s(xi)</EM> and <EM>di=s'(xi)</EM>) and 
    its evaluation at some points must be done by the <LINK>interp</LINK> function.

    </DESCRIPTION>

    <SECTION label="Remarks">
    <P> When <VERB>wd</VERB> is not given, all the points have the same weight 1.</P>
    <P> A point <EM>(xd(k),yd(k))</EM> is considered in the fit if <EM>xd(k) in [x1,xn]
        and  wd(k) &gt; 0</EM>. In particular you can put a null (or even negative) weight to
        all data points you want to ignore in the fitting. When the total number of points
        taken into account in the fit procedure is (strictly) less than 4 an error is issued.  
    </P>
    <P> The vector <VERB>xd</VERB> do not need to be in increasing order. 
    </P>
    <P> Depending on the number and on the positions of the <EM>xd(k)</EM> 's and on the choice 
        of the <EM>x(i)</EM> 's there may be several solutions but only one is selected. When this
        occurs a warning message is displayed in the Scilab command window. This function is intended 
        to be used when <EM>m</EM> is much larger than <EM>n</EM> and in this case no such problem
        may occured.
