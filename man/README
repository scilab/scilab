*******************************
Chapters location and title are given in the Scilab variable
%helps. This variable is a matrix of character strings with
N rows and two columns. N is the number of chapters.
The first row of the variable %helps, i.e. %helps(1,:)
is made of the two strings 
SCIDIR+"/man"/"programming" (=the pathname of the first Chapter directory)
and 
"Scilab Programming" (=the title of the first Chapter).

 Scilab needs a "whatis" file in each Chapter directory with a
keyword followed by a brief description of the keyword. 

To add a new help chapter, the user needs to:

 - create the associated directory and help files (with extension
   .cat) 
 - create the "whatis"  file 
 - include the directory  path and title in the variable %helps
   %helps=[%helps; ["New_Path_Dir","New_Title"]];

For instance, if you want that the command "help my_item" works,
you should write two files:

The file my_item.cat should contain the material displayed.
The file whatis should contain a brief description of my_item.
Assuming that these files are located in the directory
/usr/home/john, the last row  of %helps  should
be:
"/usr/home/john"   "A-title"

The scilab *.cat files can be generated from *.man files by
"formatman" Scilab function and the whatis files are also
generated.
