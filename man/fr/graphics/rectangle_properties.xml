  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="rectangle_properties">description of the Rectangle
  entity properties</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>The Rectangle entity is a leaf of the graphics entities hierarchy. This
    entity defines the parameters for rectangles and filled rectangles.</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="parent: ">
        <SP>This field contains the handle of the parent. The parent of the
        rectancle entity should be of the type <VERB>"Axes"</VERB> or
        <VERB>"Compound"</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="children: ">
        <SP>This property contains a vector with the <VERB>children</VERB> of
        the handle. However, <VERB>rectangle</VERB> handles currently do not
        have any <VERB>children</VERB>.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property
        value for the polyline. Its value should be <VERB>"on"</VERB> (marks
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no marks drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_style</VERB> property value is used to select the
        type of mark to use when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. The value should be an integer in [0 14] which
        stands for: dot, plus, cross, star, filled diamond, diamond, triangle
        up, triangle down, diamond plus, circle, asterisk, square, triangle
        right, triangle left and pentagram.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size_unit: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB>
        property value. If <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"point"</VERB>, then the <VERB>mark_size</VERB> value is
        directly given in points. When <VERB>mark_size_unit</VERB> is set to
        <VERB>"tabulated"</VERB>, <VERB>mark_size</VERB> is computed relative
        to the font size array: therefore, its value should be an integer in
        [0 5] whith stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt. Note that
        <LINK>xrect</LINK> and pure scilab functions use
        <VERB>tabulated</VERB> mode as default ; when using <LINK>plot</LINK>
        function, the <VERB>point</VERB> mode is automatically enabled.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_size: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>mark_size</VERB> property is used to select the type of
        size of the marks when <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. Its value should be an integer in [0 5] whith
        stands for 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt and 24pt.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_foreground: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_foreground</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' edge color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="mark_background: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>mark_background</VERB> property
        value which is the marks' face color. Its value should be a color
        index (relative to the current color_map).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_mode: ">
        <SP>This field contains the default <VERB>line_mode</VERB> property
        value for the rectangle. Its value should be <VERB>"on" </VERB>(line
        drawn) or <VERB>"off"</VERB> (no line drawn).</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="fill_mode: ">
        <SP>If <VERB>fill_mode</VERB> property value is <VERB>"on" </VERB>,
        the rectangle is filled with the foreground color, the
        <VERB>mark_mode</VERB> must also have the value <VERB>"off"</VERB>. if
        not and the value's property is <VERB>"off"</VERB> only the shape of
        the rectangle is drawn using the foreground color.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="line_style: ">
        <SP>The <VERB>line_style</VERB> property value should be an integer in
        [1 6]. 1 stands for solid the other value stands for a selection of
        dashes.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="thickness: ">
        <SP>This field contains the line <VERB>thickness</VERB> property. Its
        value should be a positif integer.</SP>

        <SP>This property is to return the coordinates of the upper-left point
        of the rectangle and its width and height in the data units of the
        axes. The result is the matrix
        <VERB>[xleft,yup,[zup],width,height]</VERB></SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="visible: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>visible</VERB> property value for
        the entity . It should be <VERB>"on" </VERB> or <VERB>"off"</VERB> .
        By default, the rectangle is visible, the value's property is
        <VERB>"on"</VERB>. If <VERB>"off"</VERB> the rectangle is not drawn on
        the screen.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_state: ">
        <SP>This field contains the <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value for
        the rectangle. It should be :</SP>

        <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"off"</VERB> this means that the rectangle is not
            clipped.</SP>

          <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
            <SP><VERB>"clipgrf"</VERB> this means that the rectangle is
            clipped outside the Axes box.</SP>

          </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
        </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="clip_box: ">
        <SP>This field is to determinate the <VERB>clip_box</VERB> property.
        By Default its value should be an empty matrix if clip_state is "off".
        Other cases the vector <VERB>[x,y,w,h]</VERB> (upper-left point width
        height) defines the portions of the rectangle to display, however
        <VERB>clip_state</VERB> property value will be changed.</SP>
      </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

      <DESCRIPTION_ITEM label="user_data: ">
        <SP>This field can be use to store any scilab variable in the
        rectangle data structure, and to retreive it.</SP>
