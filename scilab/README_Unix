 I - TO INSTALL SCILAB
 *********************

  A - IF YOU HAVE A COMPILED VERSION
  ----------------------------------

    Simply do, in Scilab directory:
      make
  B - IF YOU HAVE A SOURCE VERSION
  --------------------------------

    This distribution has been tested on the following machines:
    SUN Sparcstation (Solaris 5.8), HPUX workstation c8000 (HP.UX 11.11) and PC linux
    (Mandriva 9.2,2005,2006, Fedora Core IV, Red Hat 9.0, Suse 10.0). But it should work on
    other UNIXes.

    You need X Window (X11R4, X11R5 or X11R6), C compiler and Fortran compiler.

    1 - Configure your system by issuing the following command in the Scilab 
        directory:
        ./configure
        Use  "./configure  --without-tk" if you don't have tcl/tk 8.4 or later 
        installed (not recommended).

        This will create and/or modify a few Makefile and other files for your 
        system.
        You can give options to configure command, see below.

    2 - Do in the Scilab directory:
        make all

        This will compile Scilab and set everything.

    Configure options:
    ------------------

        --enable-debug: compile with "-g" option and do not optimize.

        --with-gcc: use gcc C compiler (note that the compilation options
           have not been tested on all machines, see C below).

        --with-g77: use g77 Fortran compiler (note that the compilations
           options have not been tested on all machines, see C below).

        --with-gfortran : use gfortran, GNU Fortran 95 compiler (note that 
           the compilations options have not been tested on all machines,
           see C below).

        --with-gnu: use gcc C compiler and gun Fortran compiler (g77 or gfortran)
           (note that the compilation options have not been tested on all machines,
           see C below).

        --with-f2c: on Linux systems, use f2c Fortran compiler.

        --x-libraries=DIR: X Window library files are in DIR.
        --x-includes=DIR: X Window include files are in DIR.

        --with-local-xaw: compile and use Athena Widgets libraries given 
           with Scilab; configure chooses local Athena Widgets 3D library 
           when needed (not recommended).

        --without-pvm: compile without PVM library. The default is to compile
           with PVM library. In this case the PVM interface is not built.

      If your PVM libraries and include files are in customized places, 
      you can specify them by hand with the following arguments:
        --with-pvm-library=DIR: PVM library files are in DIR
        --with-pvm-include=DIR: PVM include files are in DIR

        --without-tk: compile without TCL/TK library. The default is to compile
           with TCL/TK library. Use this option if you do not have libraries of 
           TCL/TK 8.4 or higher installed (not recommended, in this case the 
           TCL/TK interface is not build, Scilab help browser, scipad edidor 
           graphic editor, ... will not be available).

      If your TCL/TK libraries and include files are in customized places, 
      or if you have several versions of TCL/TK installed you can specify them 
      by hand with all the following arguments:
        --with-tcl-library=DIR: Tcl library files are in DIR
        --with-tcl-include=DIR: Tcl include files are in DIR
        --with-tk-library=DIR: Tk library files are in DIR
        --with-tk-include=DIR: Tk include files are in DIR

        -without-ocaml : do not compile with ocaml.

        --without-java : do not compile  Java interface.

        --with-atlas-library=DIR: use the optimized version of BLAS (ATLAS)

        --prefix=DIR: scilab will install itself in DIR/scilab-4.1.2
           and create 3 symlinks in DIR/bin
        By default prefix=/usr

      If you already have PVM installed, you should set PVM_ROOT before
      running configure. Usually, PVM_ROOT=/usr/local/lib/pvm

      On FreeBSD, you should use the scilab port in /usr/ports/math/scilab
      If you wish to build scilab by hand you should follow the following
      rules (with PREFIX=/usr/local):
        * If PVM is not already installed you should use --without-pvm.
        * If PVM is installed you must set the PVM library and include
        directories accordingly. Usually: --with-pvm-library=$PREFIX/lib and
        --with-pvm-include=$PREFIX/include
        * If you wish to use Tk (--with-tk), you must set the tcl/tk library
        and include directories accordingly. Usually:
        --with-tk-library=$PREFIX/lib
        --with-tk-include=$PREFIX/include
        --with-tcl-library=$PREFIX/lib
        --with-tcl-include=$PREFIX/include
        * You should set the CFLAGS variable before running configure to set
        specific compilation options. Usually: CFLAGS="-O -pipe"
        * You should set the correct prefix. Usually: --prefix=$PREFIX

      On NetBSD, you should use the scilab package in /usr/pkgsrc/math/scilab
      If you wish to build scilab by hand you should follow the following
      rules (with PREFIX=/usr/local):
         * If PVM is not already installed you should use --without-pvm.
         * If PVM is installed you must set the PVM library and include
         directories accordingly. Usually: --with-pvm-library=$PREFIX/lib and
         --with-pvm-include=$PREFIX/include
         * If you wish to use Tk (--with-tk), you must set the tcl/tk library
         and include directories accordingly. Usually:
         --with-tk-library=$PREFIX/lib
         --with-tk-include=$PREFIX/include
         --with-tcl-library=$PREFIX/lib
         --with-tcl-include=$PREFIX/include
         * You should set the CFLAGS variable before running configure to set
         specific compilation options. Usually: CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe"
         * You should set the correct prefix. Usually: --prefix=$PREFIX


  C - CHANGING THE COMPILATION OPTIONS (source version only)
  ----------------------------------------------------------

      You may want to change the options used to compile Scilab, names of the
      compilers, compilation options, linker options, and so on; you can easily 
      do that.

      The main "Makefile" of Scilab includes "Makefile.incl" and
      "config/Makefile.<machine>":
       - "Makefile.incl" contains all the compilation options
       - "config/Makefile.<machine>" is only used for the link of the executable 
         "scilex" of Scilab.

      The file "Makefile.incl" is included by all the Makefiles of the 
      distribution, so it is THE place where you can change compilation 
      options (it is self documented).

      Note that "Makefile.incl" is automatically generated by "configure"
      from "Makefile.incl.in", so your modifications of "Makefile.incl" are
      discarded every time you run "configure". 
      Users knowing the way "configure" works may want to modify directly the 
      "configure" file.

      Even more, users knowing the way "autoconf" works may want to modify 
      the "configure.in" file and then run "autoconf" to generate
      the "configure" file.

  D - CUSTOMIZING YOUR SCILAB
  ---------------------------

    1 - By default Scilab includes its own browser written in TCL/TK.
        But it is possible to choose another one. See the section
        "Browser choice" of "man" help to do it.

    2 - If you want to recompile Scilab after modifications, execute only 
        the "make all" command in Scilab directory (source version only).

        If you want to clean all executable, object files and libraries 
        and then recompile Scilab, execute the following commands
        (source version only):
        make distclean
        make all

    3 - To print your postscript figures, the list of printers is defined
        in the environment variable "PRINTERS" or in the beginning of 
        the shell script "bin/scilab".

    4 - Icons for windows managers: icons for Scilab, Scilab graphics windows
        are given in the X11_defaults subdirectory. See the README in
        this subdirectory.

    5 - COLOR RESOURCES: if you want to change the colors of your 
        customization you need to modify the files in the X11_defaults
        subdirectory (essentially the Xscilab file) or to copy the same
        color resources in your personal resource file (home directory).

 ******************************************************************************
 II - REMARKS
 ************

    0 - This binary version has been compiled with "libc.so.6" linked to 
        "libc-2.3.X.so". So it may not work on old Linux distributions where 
        "libc.so.6" is linked to older "libc" libraries.

        A binary version for old "libc.so.6" libraries will be available soon.

    1 - Note that C routines are not all ANSI.

    2 - If there is something wrong when you open the scilab window 
        check your ".Xdefault" or ".Xresource" file.

    3 - Athena Widgets libraries libXaw.a and libXmu.a (and corresponding 
        include files) are not systematically provided in some X11 
        installations. If you are using X11R5 or X11R6, these libraries are 
        provided for convenience with Scilab.
        "configure" first tries to find existing Athena Widgets libraries.
        If none are found and X Window release is not X11R4, it uses
        local Athena Widgets libraries. Otherwise an error is issued.
        You can impose the use of local Athena Widgets libraries by using
        the option "--with-local-Xaw" with "configure".

    4 - For HP workstation, programs to be incrementally linked should
        be compiled with the option "+z" or "+Z".

    5 - Binary versions compiled with Scilab's tcl/tk interface include TCL/TK
        libraries in "tcl" directory.

    6 - If you have any problem or suggestion to improve Scilab

          http://www.scilab.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla_bug_II/index.cgi

        or better post a message to newsgroup:

          comp.soft-sys.math.scilab

 ******************************************************************************
 III - TO RUN SCILAB
 *******************

 Run Scilab by executing "scilab" (shell script in bin).

 If the name of the directory of Scilab distribution is not the same on 
 your machine than on the machine where Scilab was installed, copy the
 bin/scilab script file somewhere, set its execution rights on, edit
 it to modify the environment variable SCI definition (it should give
 the pathname to the directory of Scilab distribution) and use this
 modified script to start Scilab.
