 I - TO INSTALL SCILAB
 *********************
 
  A - IF YOU HAVE A COMPILED VERSION
  ----------------------------------
    Simply do, in Scilab directory:
 	make
   
  B - IF YOU HAVE A SOURCE VERSION
  --------------------------------
    This distribution has been tested on the following machines:
    HP9000, SUN Sparcstation (Solaris 5.*), DEC alpha OSF, PC linux and
    Mac Linux PPC. But it should work on other UNIXes.
 
    You need X Window (X11R4, X11R5 or X11R6), Athena Widgets libraries, 
    C compiler and Fortran compiler.
 
    1 - Configure your system by issuing the following command in the Scilab 
        directory:
 	./configure --with-tk
	Or simply "./configure" if you don't have tcl/tk 8.0 or later 
        installed.
 
        This will create and/or modify a few Makefile and other files for your 
        system.
        You can give options to configure command, see below.
 
    2 - Do in the Scilab directory:
 	make all
 
        This will compile Scilab and set everything.

    Configure options:
    ------------------
 	--enable-debug: compile with "-g" option and do not optimize.
 
 	--with-gcc: use gcc C compiler (note that the compilation options
           have not been tested on all machines, see C below).
 
 	--with-g77: use g77 Fortran compiler (note that the compilations
           options have not been tested on all machines, see C below).
 
 	--with-gnu: use gcc C compiler and g77 Fortran compiler (note that 
           the compilation options have not been tested on all machines, 
           see C below).

        --with-f2c: on Linux systems, use f2c Fortran compiler.
 
         --x-libraries=DIR: X Window library files are in DIR.
         --x-includes=DIR: X Window include files are in DIR.
 
 	--with-local-Xaw: compile and use Athena Widgets libraries given 
           with Scilab (do not use then for X11R4); configure chooses local
           Athena Widgets library when needed, so the use of this option is not
           recommanded (see below KNOWN PROBLEMS 3).

        --with-xaw3d: use 3D version of Athena Widgets.

        --without-pvm: compile without PVM library. The default is to compile
           with PVM library.
 
        --with-tk: compile with TCL/TK library. The default is to compile
           without TCL/TK library. You must have libraries of TCL/TK 8.x and 
           corresponding include files installed in standard directory 
           (configure is looking for them).
           If your libraries and include files are in customized places, 
           you can specify them by hand with the following arguments:
        --with-tcl-library=DIR: Tcl library files are in DIR
        --with-tcl-include=DIR: Tcl include files are in DIR
        --with-tk-library=DIR: Tk library files are in DIR
        --with-tk-include=DIR: Tk include files are in DIR
 
  C - CHANGING THE COMPILATION OPTIONS (source version only)
  ------------------------------------
     You may want to change the options used to compile Scilab, names of the
     compilers, compilation options, linker options, and so on; you can easily 
     do that.
 
     The main "Makefile" of Scilab includes "Makefile.incl" and
     "config/Makefile.<machine>":
       "Makefile.incl" contains all the compilation options
       "config/Makefile.<machine>" is only used for the link of the executable 
           "scilex" of Scilab.
 
    The file "Makefile.incl" is included by all the Makefiles of the 
    distribution, so it is THE place where you can change compilation 
    options (it is self documented).
 
    Note that "Makefile.incl" is automatically generated by "configure"
    from "Makefile.incl.in", so your modifications of "Makefile.incl" are
    discarded every time you run "configure". 
    Users knowing the way "configure" works may want to modify directly the 
    "configure" file.
    Even more, users knowing the way "autoconf" works may want to modify 
    the "configure.in" file and then run "autoconf" (version 2.13) to generate
    the "configure" file.
 
  D - CUSTOMIZING YOUR SCILAB
  ---------------------------
    1 - If you want to recompile Scilab after modifications, execute only 
        the "make all" command in Scilab directory (source version only).
 
        If you want to clean all executable, object files and libraries 
        and then recompile Scilab, execute the following commands
        (source version only):
 	make distclean
 	make all
 
    2 - To print your postscript figures, the list of printers is defined
        in the environment variable "PRINTERS" or in the beginning of 
        the shell script "bin/scilab".
 
    3 - Note that the functions "macros/util/edit" and
        "macros/util/manedit" assume that your default editor 
        is emacs. You may change this in the corresponding function (or 
        explicitly specify your editor when you invoke these functions).
 
    4 - Icons for windows managers: icons for Scilab, Scilab graphics windows
        and Metanet graphics windows are given in the X11_defaults
        subdirectory. See the README in this subdirectory.
 
    5 - COLOR RESOURCES: if you want to change the colors of your 
        customization you need to modify the files in the X11_defaults
        subdirectory (essentially the Xscilab file) or to copy the same
        color resources in your personal resource file (home directory).
 
 ******************************************************************************
 II - KNOWN PROBLEMS AND REMARKS
 *******************************
    0 - Note that C routines are not all ANSI.
 
    1 - If there is something wrong when you open the scilab window 
        check your ".Xdefault" or ".Xresource" file.
 
    2 - The Fortran compiler version 1.3.1 of SUN Sparcstations has a bug:
        reading or writing (with implicit loop) arrays  bigger than 4096 
        elements does not work. This may cause Scilab to abort.
        The solution is to upgrade your Fortran compiler, for instance get 
        version 1.4 (or use version 1.3.1 with object file "recio.o" from 
        newer version).
 
    3 - Athena Widgets libraries libXaw.a and libXmu.a (and corresponding 
        include files) are not systematically provided in some X11 
        installations. If you are using X11R5 or X11R6, these libraries are 
        provided for convenience with Scilab.
        "configure" first tries to find existing Athena Widgets libraries.
        If none are found and X Window release is not X11R4, it uses
        local Athena Widgets libraries. Otherwise an error is issued.
        You can impose the use of local Athena Widgets libraries by using
        the option "--with-local-Xaw" with "configure".
 
        On some IBM RS6000 there exists a compatibility problem between the
        X11-Mit distribution and the IBM version. If your system runs the IBM
        X11 release you must use the IBM libXaw.a and libXmu.a libraries.
 
    4 - For DEC ALPHA workstation you must use the 3.4 or newer version
        of the Fortran compiler (the 3.3 version aborts on floating
        point exceptions). You are encouraged to use the OSF 3.0 system
        release and the Fortran 3.5 release (the incremental link works
        fine as well as all the floating point exceptions).
 
    5 - For HP workstation, programs to be incrementally linked should
        be compiled with the option "+z" or "+Z".
 
    6 - Binary versions compiled with Scilab's tcl/tk interface include TCL/TK
        libraries in "tcl" directory.

    7 - If you have any problem or suggestion to improve Scilab
        send an email to:
        
                           Scilab@inria.fr
 
        or better post a message to newsgroup:
 
 		      comp.soft-sys.math.scilab
 
 ******************************************************************************
 III - TO RUN SCILAB
 *******************
 
 Run Scilab by executing "scilab" (shell script in bin).
 
 If the name of the directory of Scilab distribution is not the same on 
 your machine than on the machine where Scilab was installed, define the
 environment variable SCI to point to the directory of Scilab distribution.
 In a sh like shell, do:
  SCI=<name of the directory>
  export SCI
 In a csh like shell, do:
  setenv SCI <name of the directory>
