                              Scilab 4.1.1
                              ============

Please note that the Scilab 4.1.1 is released for two main reasons :
- to have a HP-UX Scilab 4.1.1 release available for Scilab users,
- to provide a Scilab version running with the Scilab - LabVIEW Gateway release 1.0

The Scilab 4.1.1 release is built from the Scilab 4.1 source with added
code to take into account the HP-UX machine and the Scilab - LabVIEW Gateway.
If you already use the Scilab 4.1 release and if the above reasons do not
concern your use of Scilab, no needs to download the 4.1.1 release.

Notice that the workaround we have added in the 4.1 release to avoid
the major bug of gfortran compiler is improved in the 4.1.1 release
(because it did not work under some platform).

For more details see our wiki page (http://wiki.scilab.org/Scilab_under_Linux_and_Unix?highlight=%28gfortran%29 )
and the GCC bugzilla page ( http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28354 )

    automatically chosen according to the CPU detected.
    See details in the Atlas.spec file under scilab\bin directory.

    Scilab can be used with Atlas library on all platforms by:

    + downloading Atlas library sources.
    + compiling Atlas sources.
    + compiling scilab sources with the following configure option : 
         --with-atlas-library=ATLAS_LIB_DIRECTORY

      (see <SCI>/configure --help).

  - Optimisations disabled for calelm/icopy.f calelm/unsfdcopy.f on every plateform,
    routines/system/getsym.f on Solaris 

  - add scilex -nogui mode no window, no interactive, no gui, no events.
    %gui variable in scilab to detect this mode.

  - Add 2 keys in registry to detect scilab (Windows): 
    On Windows XP 32 bits 
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Scilab] "LASTINSTALL"="Scilab-4.1" 
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Scilab\Scilab-4.1] "SCIPATH"="\"C:\\Program Files\\scilab-4.1\"" 

    On Windows XP 64 bits 
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Scilab] "LASTINSTALL"="Scilab-4.1" 
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Scilab\Scilab-4.1] "SCIPATH"="\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\scilab-4.1\""

    Warning: Because of distinction of click events, some users' scripts can 
    have a different behavior.
    To make it work as before please check and modified test on events as follow:
    supposing that button contains the value returned by xclick (left most argument) 
    or xgetmouse (third componant of returned vector) then replace test like:
      button==0 by or(button==[0,3])
      button==1 by or(button==[1,4])

they can be exchanged. In particular (compiled macros) *.bin files and
*.cos (scicos diagrams) can be exchanged.

It is now possible to dynamically link C++ procedures with Scilab.

A new data type "mlist" has been added.

A new function "genlib" allows users to compile the .sci files in a
given directory, generate associated library and load it. This
function is particularly useful under windows if VC++ is not
available. 

C formatted input output functions (printf, scanf, ..) have been
interfaced to scilab.

OTHERS IMPROVEMENTS
===================
Efficiency has been improved using reference argument passing when
possible instead of value passing.

Hypermatrix opreations have been accelerated.

On X Window systems 3D Athena Widgets are preferably used instead of
standard  Athena Widgets for a better look.

The "Matlab 4" to Scilab translator has been completed and considerably
improved.

and some functions acting on them have been added. 

A library of procedures has been added to allow the use of Matlab
mex-files under Scilab.

used, instead a Scilab variable "helps" is used.





		     Main Changes Scilab 2.4 -> 2.4.1
		     ================================

Many bugs fixed.

Option "--without-pvm" added to configure to compile Scilab 
  without PVM library.

               has been improved. Sparse matrices are handled. There is
               now the choice between C and Fortran code generation.

Nonlinear toolbox: Addition of 2D and 3D definite integrals int2d et int3d.

Data types: N dimensional arrays have been introduced (see hypermatrices).

chdir and getcwd functions added to change and get working directory.

Floating points exception handling may be set by "ieee" function.

Overloading: It is now possible to overload display of tlist data
             structure. It is also possible to extend basic primitive
             function definition to new data types. To avoid possible
             ambiguity overloading function names have been
             changed. Old names still work, but for efficiency it
             desirable to change it. See overloading help.

Syntax: Functions with strings arguments may be called as commands.
        For instance "exec('foo.sce')" can be entered as "exec foo.sce".

        It is now possible to define functions with unbounded number
        of input and output arguments (see varargin help).

INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

Some old Scicos diagrams may not be translated properly into Scilab 2.4.
