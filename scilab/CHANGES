        Welcome to Scilab 6
        ===================

This file details the changes between Scilab 6.0.0-beta-1,
this release, and the previous release 5.5.2. For changelogs with
earlier release, please see Scilab 5.5.2.

This file is intended for the specific needs of advanced users, and
describes:
 - New and modified features, in each module,
 - Changes in functions (removed/added/modified),
 - Changes in the language,
 - Bug fixes.

This changelog is most likely incomplete, as an enormous amount of
code has changed between 5.5.2 and 6. Please report any thing we could
have missed, on the mailing lists or on http://bugzilla.scilab.org,
and we will correct it before the final Scilab 6.0.0 release.

Main new Features
=================

For high-level description of the main new features of this release,
please consult the file modules/helptools/data/pages/homepage-en_US.html.
It is also available as the "What's new" page of the help, by simply typing
"help" in Scilab console.

In summary, the main new features are:

 * New language parser and interpreter, ensuring:
   - Support for bigger data sets: dynamic memory usage.
     No need for "stacksize" anymore.
   - Xcos also uses the new re-written Scilab engine.

 * New code productivity features: full-featured debugger, profiler
   and coverage tool, and "lint"-like commands.

 * Newsfeed, providing a continuous feed of news, tips, and general
   communication from the community and from Scilab Enterprises.

 * Licensing change: Scilab is now released under the terms of the GNU
   General Public License (GPL) v2.0 (but continues to be available
   under the terms of the CeCILL v2.1).


API modification
================

 * (new in 6.0.0 beta-1) A new set of C APIs to write C or C++
   extensions (toolboxes) to Scilab. It allows defining native
   functions (commonly called “gateways”), getting input parameters
   for such functions, setting return parameters, accessing local
   variables, using common helper functions for accessing environment
   information (such as warning level), generate errors... It also
   includes ways to overload existing Scilab functions to support
   additional parameter types (see scilab_overload). Finally, you can
   call back Scilab functions (macros and built-in functions) from
   your gateway (see scilab_call).

* User-defined functions written in C (gateways) must now use the
  "pvApiCtx" name for their second parameter, for example:


     int sci_Levkov(char *fname, void* pvApiCtx)

 instead of any "unsigned long l". This is now requires for some
 macros, such as Rhs(), to work. (Although not strictly an API change,
 it may require gateway code to be modified).


Other feature changes
=====================

* Valgrind error detection added to test_run (on Linux only)

* Addition or subtraction with an empty matrix now return an empty matrix.

* SSE2, Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 support is now mandatory to run
  Scilab on Linux i686.

* A call stack limit has been introduced. Default maximum depth is
  setup to 1000 andcan be changed by new function recursionlimit or by
  preferences interface.

* The floating point exception mode (ieee) is now set to 2 by default:
  floating point exceptions now produce "Inf" or "Nan", and do not
  cause any error. The previous behavior can be recalled by simply
  calling: ieee(0)


Other feature additions
=======================

* scatter/scatter3 plot with different mark colors is now available.

* parulacolormap is now available.

* name2rgb can now handle a single string and a matrix of strings.

* isoview, isoview on, isoview off, isoview(idGraphics, "on"|"off") are now supported

* householder() can now return the reflection matrix, and has a demo.

* ndgrid() can now works with any types of homogeneous data

* bench_run() can now return its results and/or record them in a file

* typeof(.., "overload") allows now to get the overloading type-code of an object

* sign() can now handle a sparse matrix.

* sleep(..,'s') allows now to specify the duration in seconds.

* deletefile can delete multiple files at once.

  are not more downloaded anymore while installing Scilab.
