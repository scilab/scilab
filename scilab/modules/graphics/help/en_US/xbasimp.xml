  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>xbasimp</VERB> sends the recorded graphics of the window
    <VERB>win_num</VERB> into the Postscript file <VERB>filen. </VERB>Note
    that the generated Postscript file cannot be direcly printed since it
    requires a header file. The Scilab command <VERB>BEpsf</VERB>,
    <VERB>Blpr</VERB> or others can be used to add a header file. The function
    <VERB>xs2eps</VERB> can be used to directly produce an encapsulated
    Postscript file with an header. If a printer is specified, the Postscript
    file is printed with the command <VERB>Blpr</VERB>. This function works
    only if the selected driver is <VERB>"Rec"</VERB>.</P>

    <P>If <VERB>win_num</VERB> is a vector, several files are generated, one
    for each selected window (with names <VERB>filenxx</VERB>), and the files
    are printed on a unique page with the command <VERB>Blpr</VERB>.</P>

    <P>The window number is appended to <VERB>filen</VERB>.</P>
