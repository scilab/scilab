  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
  When the event handler mode is enable, Scilab will call the specified event handler
  function each time an event occures in the graphic window. The event handler function
  must comply with the above prototype. Each time an event occured, the function is called
  and its four parameters are set accordingly to the window number, mouse position and
  type of event.
  </P>

  <P>
    The <VERB>ibut</VERB> parameter takes one of the following value depending on event type:
  </P>
  <ITEMIZE>
    <ITEM label="ibut==0">
      <SP>: Left mouse button has been pressed</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==1">
      <SP>: Middle mouse button has been pressed</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==2">
      <SP>: Right mouse button has been pressed</SP>
      <P></P>
    </ITEM>

    <ITEM label="ibut==3">
      <SP>: Left mouse button has been clicked</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==4">
      <SP>: Middle mouse button has been clicked</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==5">
      <SP>: Right mouse button has been clicked</SP>
      <P></P>
    </ITEM>

    <ITEM label="ibut==10">

      <P></P>
    </ITEM>

    <ITEM label="ibut==-5">

    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==-4">
      <SP>: Middle mouse button has been released</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==-3">
      <SP>: Right mouse button has been released</SP>
      <P></P>
    </ITEM>

    <ITEM label="ibut==-1">
      <SP>: mouse pointer has moved</SP>
      <P></P>
    </ITEM>

    <ITEM label="ibut &gt; =32">
      <SP>: key with ascii code ascii(ibut) has been pressed</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut &lt; =-32">
      <SP>: key with ascii code ascii(-ibut)   has been released</SP>
    <P></P>
    </ITEM>
	
    <ITEM label="ibut &gt; =1000+32">
      <SP>: key with ascii code ascii(ibut-1000) has been pressed while CTRL
       key pressed</SP>
    </ITEM>
    <ITEM label="ibut==-1000">
      <SP>: graphic window has been closed</SP>
    </ITEM>
  </ITEMIZE>

  <P>
  For example, let say that the name of the event handler function is fooHandler
  for window number 0. A left click in the window at position [100,150] (in pixels)
  will be equivalent as calling fooHandler( 0, 100, 150, 3 ).
  </P>

  <P>
  See <LINK>figure_properties</LINK> or <LINK>seteventhandler</LINK> for information on
  how to specify the event_handler name.
  </P>
