                When the file contains several variables being graphic handles or any other
                variables of any types, the loading order of variables (and so of related
                graphics) is the <emphasis>alphabetical order of the variables names</emphasis>.
                So, it is usually NOT the order the variables (among which the handles) have
                been listed in the save() statement!
            </para>
            <para>
                This may yield some unexpected results when several saved graphic handles
                have the same parent figure or are parent or children of each others, but with
                variables names whose alphabetical order does not match the order of their
                graphical hierarchy.
