  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>min_weight_tree</VERB> tries to find a minimum weight
    spanning tree for the graph <VERB>g</VERB>. The optional argument
    <VERB>i</VERB> is the number of the root node of the tree; its
    default value is node number 1. This node is meaningless for an
    undirected graph.</P>
    <P>
    The weights are given by the <VERB>weight</VERB> field of the
    graph <LINK>edges_data_structure</LINK>.  If its value is not
    given, it is assumed to be equal to 0 on each edge.  Weigths can
    be positive, equal to 0 or negative. To compute a spanning tree
    without dealing with weights, give to weights a value of 0 on each
    edge.</P>
    <P><VERB>min_weight_tree</VERB> returns the tree <VERB>t</VERB> as
    a row vector of the arc numbers (directed graph) or edge numbers
    (undirected graph) if it exists or the empty vector
    <VERB>[]</VERB> otherwise.  If the tree exists, the dimension of
    <VERB>t</VERB> is the number of nodes less 1.  If
    <VERB>t(i)</VERB> is the root of the tree: - for j &lt; i,
    <VERB>t(j)</VERB> is the number of the arc in the tree after node
    <VERB>t(j)</VERB> - for j &gt; i, <VERB>t(j)</VERB> is the number
    of the arc in the tree before node <VERB>t(j)</VERB></P>
