  <DESCRIPTION>
    <SP><VERB>save_graph</VERB> saves the graph <VERB>g</VERB> in a graph file.
    <VERB>path</VERB> is the name of the graph file where the graph will be saved.
    <VERB>path</VERB> can be the name or the pathname of the file; if the 
    <VERB>&quot;graph&quot;</VERB> extension is missing in <VERB>path</VERB>, it is assumed.
    If <VERB>path</VERB> is the name of a directory, the name of the graph is
    used as the name of the file.</SP>
    <P> Standard <LINK>save</LINK> function may also be used to save a
    graph in a file. In this case take care to save only a single
    graph data structure in the file (without any other variable) if
    you want to reload this file with <LINK>load_graph</LINK> or
    <LINK>edit_graph</LINK>.</P>
  </DESCRIPTION>

<![CDATA[
g=load_graph(SCI+'/demos/metanet/mesh100.graph');
show_graph(g);
save_graph(g,'mymesh100.graph');
g=load_graph('mymesh100.graph');
show_graph(g,'new');
