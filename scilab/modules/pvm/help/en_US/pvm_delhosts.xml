    <title>Description</title>
    <para><literal>pvm_delhosts</literal> deletes the computers named in
    <literal>hosts</literal>
    from the existing configuration of computers making up the virtual
    machine.
    All PVM processes and the pvmd running on these computers are
    killed as the computer is deleted.
    The array <literal>info</literal>
    can be checked to determine the status of each host.
    Values less than zero indicate an error,
    while zero values indicate a success.</para>
    <para>
    If a host fails, the PVM system will continue to work and will
    automatically delete the failing host from the virtual machine.
    It is the responsibility of the application developer to make his
    application tolerant of host failure.</para>
