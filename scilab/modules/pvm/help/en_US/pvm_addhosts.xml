    <para><literal>pvm_addhosts</literal>
    adds the computers named in the row matrix <literal>hosts</literal>
    to the configuration of computers making up the virtual machine.
    The names should have the same syntax as lines of a pvmd hostfile: 
    i.e a hostname followed by options of the form xx=y 
    (see man page for pvmd3).</para>
    <para>
    The row matrix <literal>info</literal> will contain for each added host 
    its status. Values less than zero indicate an error,
    while positive values are TIDs of the new hosts.</para>
    <para>
    The status of hosts can be requested by the application using
     <literal>pvm_config</literal>.
    If a host fails it will be automatically deleted from the configuration.
    Using pvm_addhosts a replacement host can be added by the application,
    however it is the responsibility of the
    application developer to make his application tolerant of host failure.
    Another use of this feature would be to add more hosts
    as they become available, for example on a weekend, or if the
    application dynamically determines it could use more computational power.</para>
