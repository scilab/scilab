    <P>For example, when you select the option and set n to 5, after every 5 statements are added,
    the history file is automatically saved.</P>
    <P>Use this option if you don't want to risk losing entries to the saved history because of an abnormal termination,
    such as a power failure.</P>
    <P>saveafterncommands() returns current value.</P>
    <P>0 is default value.</P>
