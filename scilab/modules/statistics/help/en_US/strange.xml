  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    The  range  is the  distance   between  the largest  and
    smaller value,   [r]=strange(x) computes   the  range of
    vector or matrix x.</P>
    <P>
    [r]=strange(x,'r')  (or   equivalently [r]=strange(x,1))
    give a row vector with the range of each column.</P>
    <P>
    [r]=strange(x,'c') (or  equivalently   [r]=strange(x,2))
    give a column vector with the range of each row.</P>
