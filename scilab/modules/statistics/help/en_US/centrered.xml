  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P>
    This  function computes  <VERB>s</VERB>,  the weigthed and centred 
    version of the numerical matrix <VERB>x</VERB>.</P>
    <P>
    For  a vector  or a  matrix  <VERB>x</VERB>, <VERB>s=wcenter(x)</VERB>
    returns in  the <VERB>(i,j)</VERB> coefficient of  the matrix 
    <VERB>s</VERB>   the  value  <VERB>(x(i,j)-xbar)/sigma</VERB>,   where  
    <VERB>xbar</VERB> is the  mean of the values of  the coefficients of
    <VERB>x</VERB> and <VERB>sigma</VERB> his standard deviation.</P>
    <P><VERB>s=wcenter(x,'r')</VERB>     (or,     equivalently,    
    <VERB>s=wcenter(x,1)</VERB>)  is the  rowwise centre  reduction of
    the  values  of <VERB>x</VERB>.   It  returns  in  the entry  <VERB>s(i,j)</VERB> 
    the value <VERB>(x(i,j)-xbarv(j))/sigmav(j)</VERB> with
    <VERB>xbarv(j)</VERB>  the mean  of the  values of  the  <VERB>j</VERB>
    column and  <VERB>sigmav(j)</VERB> the standard  deviation of the
    <VERB>j</VERB> column of <VERB>x</VERB>.</P>
    <P><VERB>s=wcenter(x,'c')</VERB>     (or,     equivalently, 
    <VERB>s=wcenter(x,2)</VERB>) is the columnwise centre reduction of
    the  values  of <VERB>x</VERB>.   It  returns  in  the entry  
    <VERB>s(i,j)</VERB> the value <VERB>(x(i,j)-xbarh(i))/sigmah(i)</VERB> with
    <VERB>xbarh(i)</VERB> the mean of the  values of the <VERB>i</VERB> row
    and <VERB>sigmah(i)</VERB> the  standard deviation of the <VERB>i</VERB>
    row of <VERB>x</VERB>.</P>
