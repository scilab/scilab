SCIPAD BUGS AND WISHES LIST


Bugs:
-----
-issues related with non colorizing single quoted text:
  . code lines such as mprintf("%s",'this is a function') break the line
    number counting in functions if not properly colorized as textquoted.
    Solution could be to detect all quoted strings, with single or double
    quotes, and .textarea tag add some invisibletextquoted aside the
    existing (visible) textquoted tag used for colorization, and use only
    invisibletextquoted for Scilab function detection within buffers, in
    other words, separate the strings detection from their colorization

-proc blinkbrace blinks even if the brackets/braces are quoted, e.g. "[" "]"

-proc blinkquote blinks even for partially commented text, e.g.
 a "string.. // this is no "string

-On some platforms certain bindings for blinking character never trigger,
 e.g. for bracketleft on Windows (AltGr-5, french keyboard) one gets
 Control_L plus parenleft - this one however blinks through the parenleft
 binding, but others such as braceleft do never trigger and gives
 Control_L plus quoteright - depends on keyboard, platform and whatnot...

-Some shortcuts may not work on certain platforms. E.g. Control-F1 does not on
 at least one Mandrake 10.1 Official Linux. Was also found on a RH8 machine.

-When a function definition line ends with a comment, the line numbering is
 wrong 1 unit, resulting in various strange behaviors: execution not stopping
 at breakpoints or not up-to-date value of variables in the watch window
 This is Scilab bug 1469 (outside of Scipad) that deals with the general
 issue of mismatch between line numbering as reported by fun2string and that
 held by the breakpoint handling

-logical line numbering issue:
   function a=foo(); a=1;
    a=2;
   endfunction
 In scipad, a=1 is on line 1; for scilab it is on line 2 of function foo
 Also related to bug 1469 - better wait for clarification on this one instead
 of working around Scilab parser bugs

-step-by-step debugging may highlight the wrong line in Scipad when continued
 lines without dots are present before the breakpoint stop. Bug 1469 again!!!

-Bug 1469 once more in the following case (mind the spaces before
 "endfunction"):
function test
  a=1
  endfunction
 In this case the debugger in single step mode will highlight line 1 after
 line 3 whereas this won't happen for:
function test
  a=1
endfunction

-watching some very large variable content looks like the variable is empty
 This is Tk bug 1449858.

-Multiple file open in the file dialog: There is a Tcl bug on tk_getOpenFile,
 which does not correctly work on Linux with -multiple 1 option. See Tcl
 bug 1614032. I have proposed a patch for this bug to the Tcl core team, but
 it is not yet committed in the Tcl source code. There is also bug 1578519
 about special dirs on Windows, still for tk_getOpenFile.

-When there are wrapped lines of varying lengths, as the user scrolls, the
length of the scroll box changes. 
 This is actually fixed in Tk 8.5: http://www.tcl.tk/cgi-bin/tct/tip/155.html
 No workaround available in 8.4, this is a deep Tk core issue.

-[me "accented_text_then_an_ampersand"] underlines the intended character,
 and seems to work perfectly, even if there are accented characters before
 the ampersand. However, launching such a menu option using the keyboard
 accelerator does apparently not trigger the associated -command proc.
 This is Tk bug #1638905 (which is a duplicate of #1599877), which is fixed
 in both 8.4.15 and 8.5a6 versions of Tcl/Tk.
 Once Scilab uses one of the above Tcl/Tk versions, check in fr.msg (in the
 menues section) whether there are missing accents on characters. I know at
 least of two occurrences where "Executer" should read "Exécuter".

-Line numbers of lines located after the active breakpoint are slightly
 misaligned with the lines they're facing. This is due to the font of the
 active breakpoint tag ($actbptextFont), which has a slightly larger size
 than $textFont, the latter being used for the line numbers.
 A general scheme should be derived so that line numbers support different
 font sizes in the text they face. The algorithm could be something like:
   . Check what tags has the line in front of the line number
   . Retrieve the -font option of the highest priority tag
   . If this is not empty, extract the -size attribute of the font and tag
     the line number with a modified $textFont having this -size
   . Otherwise (the -font option of the higest priority tag is an empty
     list) check out the tag that is of priority just below the highest
     and run the game again
   . When there is no tag left, use the $textFont -size value as a fallback
 Beware of performance issues here! This must be done for each visible line!
 Moreover, this would still not be perfect: mixed sizes inside single lines
 would not be supported (but such complications are anyway not used in
 Scipad currently)
 Easier fix: use the same size for all the fonts displayed in textareas!


Old bugs/whishes which have been hacked but could have been done better:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-the window geometry is now managed in pixels. This is fine for restoring
 exactly the same window geometry as in the previous session, but loses
 some advantages of the previously broken grid management, such as resize
 of the window upon font size changes.

-2nd-button now succeeds in importing an X external selection into scipad
 under linux. With one remaining glitch, the insertion cursor zomps back
 to the beginning of the insertion at the end of the process.
 Under windows 2nd-button is ineffective if the selection is external, 
 but has the side effect (with some glitches) to drop at the mouse point the
 selection it is within scipad
 On Windows:btn-2 in the same textarea as the selection: it's a move (wrong!),
 while btn-2 in another textarea: it's a copy/paste
 On Linux: always copy/paste (correct)

-Make printing from Scipad work on Linux and implement it for Windows.
 Try to preserve the colorization in the process.

 http://www.du.edu/~mschwart/tclextensions.html (printer extension)
 http://www.nyx.net/~mschwart/ (printer extension)
 -- Printing works on Linux and now also on Windows. It makes use of Scilab
    internal new functions that do not preserve colorization. I'm convinced
    that an internal Tk printing scheme would be better.

-trying to debug functions with names > 24 characters does not work. This is
 a very general Scilab limitation (in the debugger context, setbpt looses
 characters for long names, that's why it doesn't work). Currently 
 a check on name length when colorizing user functions has been added to
 remind the user from this limit. Only this visual hint is provided, i.e.
 configure execution will propose too long names. Scipad or the debugger
 is not limited to 24 chars, but Scilab still is. Let's wait for Scilab
 improvement instead of restraining the debugger!

-anything could happen during debug if the same function name can be found more
 than once among the opened buffers, for instance the wrong buffer could become
 the active one to show the active breakpoint - same issue in configureexec:
 if a function is defined in more than one buffer, proc checkarglist may
 detect the wrong one and prevent correct configuration of the debugger
 Since duplicate function definitions are not supported by the debugger, a
 warning is issued to the user, and the debugger refuses to execute
 To let the debugger support this would perhaps be desirable


Wishes:
-------

Debugger wishes:

-Conditional breakpoints

-Allow to watch a generic expression (bonus: the expression could be e.g.
 a graphical command, so that an array is *plotted* at each breakpoint)
 Way to go: add a pane with expressions to be executed and result of their
 evaluation displayed in the watch window area (e.g. size(a_matrix,"*"))
 Hmm, maybe a separate toplevel would be better - the watch is already a
 pretty large window...

-Add a field showing the type (and size) of the variables displayed in the
 watch window

-Scipad defines and uses, mostly for the debugger, some variables in order to
 send values to Scipad. All these variables currently start with the prefix 
 db_, in order to reduce the risk of the use of such variable names in Scilab
 for another purpose, e.g. in the function to be debugged. We could use more
 sophisticated things to be absolutely sure that the variable names 
 instantiated by Scipad are not used in Scilab, so that conflicts would 
 always be avoided. For instance, browsing the existing known
 variables and checking for existence, etc. could be used (who, who_user...)

-Avoid to destroy and recreate the whole watch window when hiding/displaying
 one of its sub-areas. Would probably require -hide option for panedwindow,
 but this one is only available from Tk 8.5 (TIP #179) - Use the global
 variable Tk85

-include profiling into the debugger

-breakpoint, activebreakpoint and continued lines tags are not visible
 when selected. No solution found so far. Only one tag with -background
 option has highest priority, and there is no -selectbackground option
 for tags
 This problem has been submitted in comp.lang.tcl, see:
 http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.tcl/browse_frm/thread/d60973524b786c0e/14a82aef3b1dd24f
 It has been suggested to create a tag that has the desired background
 attributes, add an execution trace on the widget command, and whenever
 the selection changes (e.g.: when the execution trace fires on a
 "tag add sel"), add this tag to the selected range.
 Personnally, I think this is a very complicated way of making this
 work, especially considering that three tags with background should
 be dealt with and combined (what about a continued line also tagged
 as a breakpointed line, in which some characters are selected?)
 Not worth the effort and complication I think.
 Now that one side margin is implemented (for line numbers), it is pretty
 easy to add further margins and this could be used to tag breakpoints
 instead of tagging the line (but there is a lot of implications: for
 instance the debugger currently scans the textarea for breakpoint tags
 and does not maintain a list of breakpointed lines)

-add a debugger command: "Show next instruction", with a little yellow arrow
 in the margin, and perhaps a breakpoint pink dot in that margin, or other
 debugger info

-add a control in the watch window to gear in an automatic mode: all the
 local variables are added and displayed when entering a function, and
 removed when the debugger leaves a function (must specify policy more
 precisely). Possible implementation would use macrovar

-highlight in color the watched variables that changed value during previous
 debugger command


Other wishes:

-parentheses and brackets get colorized in colors according to their level
 of nesting

-unmatched parentheses are highlighted (e.g. stroke-tru) like in Matlab's 
 editor

-highlighting of for--end, while--end, select--end blocks while
 typing, like for parentheses; scope background remains highlighted in a
 background tint (choose a suitable scheme for nested structures), OR,
 block keywords are highlighted in different colors than standard keywords.

-a taylored 3rd-button popup menu (currently it is just the edit menu) - i.e.
 it includes execute selection, comment/uncomment this line, insert/delete
 breakpoints
 Note: a first step to this has been implemented. During a debug session, 
 the popup menu is a debug menu.

-(customizable?) tool bar
 Note: a first step to this has been implemented in the debugger watch window.

-Blink single quotes. More difficult than to blink double quotes because
 of the transpose case

-'Matlab' colorization scheme for .m files

-"auto smart wrap on": lines exceeding a margin could be truncated at
 word boundaries with .. dots and \n

-Add an eventual "revert to defaults button" (colors option menu)

-Currently any character typed in the buffer is inserted if there is
 no selection. Add a mode toggled by the Ins key in which characters
 would replace the existing ones. Add a visual indicator of this state.
 Note: this should be manageable in Tk8.4 using a combination of a delete
 and an insert (or perhaps selecting the next character and then puttext)
 but there is a new text widget subcommand .text replace in Tk 8.5
 that will do it at once and manage the undo/redo stacks at the same time.
 See TIP #155 for details: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/fellowsd-bin/TIP/155.html
 .text replace is available at least from 8.5a3

-*maybe* a global undo stack instead of one per buffer
 advantages: can undo at once a dnd from one pane to another one
 drawbacks : big big implementation work if the built-in undo of the text
             widget was abandoned, but maybe it could be feasible to detect
             changes in the undo stacks of more than one buffer at the same
             time - still tricky...
 Note that as per TIP 169 peers already share one single undo stack

-minimal Scipad wm size: Probably it would be wise to make the minimum
 dependent on the number of tiles, so that all the features (menu, title,
 textbuffer, scrollbars...) remain visible - take fontsize and locale into
 account
 warning: updating minsize on file open or dnd could lead to a very large
 window, therefore minsize should also be clamped to some clever maximum

-Improvements for find/replace:
  . The find/replace entries in the dialog could be comboboxes retaining
    the strings previously searched or replaced
      o combobox 2.3 and BWidgets 1.7.0 are currently in the Scilab distro
        and both provide comboboxes. We could link Scipad to them, but
        apparently the Tile package, which also provides combos, is now
        included in Tk and will be part of Tk 8.5.
  . Multiline find/replace and find in files (must wait for Tk8.5 since in
    8.4 .text search searches on a per line basis - or use regexp instead
    of .text search, big work...) - Automatically expand the entry widgets
    size according to the length of what is pasted inside them
  . More than one results window for find in files (user can select a
    target window that will contain the search results)
  . More than one find in files thread at the same time

-detect duplicate/missing underlines detection in the message files

-Improve further the regexps for continued lines detection, the goal being
 to detect only legal (in the Scilab parser sense) continued lines.

-Emacs bindings in Scipad. Proposed list is at:
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.soft-sys.math.scilab/browse_thread/thread/dc0807b11fb118ab/9fe94a45d23f92fe

-Add a function "Beautify code" for Scilab schemes: (optionally) suppress
 tabs, and reindents according to keywords (if, function, while, for...)

-Request 262: tabbed buffers (see discussion in this request)
