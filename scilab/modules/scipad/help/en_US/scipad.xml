    <title>Description</title>
    <para>Scipad is an embedded Scilab text editor written in Tcl/Tk. It can be
    started with a fresh text buffer pressing the "Editor" button on top of 
    the main Scilab window, or from Scilab command line with the instruction 
    <literal>scipad()</literal>, or it can open specific files if invoked
    with any of the calling sequences above.</para>
    <para>The same invocation adds further files to an already opened Scipad.
    If any of the arguments is a directory pathname, a file chooser
    starting in that directory pops up, allowing (multiple) selection of files.</para>
    <para>Scipad allows Windows like edition modes. Keyboard shortcuts are
    defined for most possible editing actions and reported by the menu
    entries.</para>
    <para>Additionally, the following shortcuts are defined:</para>

    <title>Debugger</title>
    <para>Scipad includes a debugger targeted to Scilab scripts and macros. The
    user can:</para>
    <para/>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Set/remove breakpoints anywhere in the opened files.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The breakpointed lines get pink background. No breakpoint can be
        set on empty, blank or commented lines.</para>
          <para/>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Configure execution.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The user has to provide the function name to execute, its variable
        names, and variable values. To ease this step, a scan of the currently
        displayed buffer is implemented to look for functions defined in it,
        scan their names and variable names. All this is displayed to the user
        in a dialog for easy selection. First, the user has to select a
        function in a spinbox, then eventually one of its variables. Once a
        variable is selected, the user can set/change its value (another
        dialog pops). Variable values and names are displayed in listboxes.
        The user can also add a new variable or remove already defined
        variables. This is in case the user changes the input variables of his
        function in the file, and he does not want to scan the buffer again
        (which causes all the variable values to be reset to a null value).
        Note also that the <link linkend="varargin">varargin</link> keyword is fully supported,
        and that variables that are not given a value by the user are ignored
        when Scipad launches the function for debug. If the current file
        contains main level code (i.e. executable code outside of a function
        definition), Scipad proposes to debug this file as a .sce file (see
        below).</para>

          <para>Scilab executes the code, and stops at the next breakpoint or goes
        to the end of the file if there is no more breakpoints. The active
        breakpoint is highlighted in Scipad so that it can easily be
        identified.</para>

        <term>Insert a new breakpoint or remove an existing breakpoint during the debug.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The breakpointed lines get pink background, and lines where
        breakpoints are removed restore their normal background. The new
        breakpoint configuration is taken into account for the next steps of
        execution or debug.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Scilab stops before execution of each line. The active stop
        position is highlighted in Scipad so that it can easily be identified.
        Every line of code in functions from opened files is taken into
        account, but Scipad does not search for or open files by itself in
        order to step into them. Lines with no executable code (blank or
        commented lines) are skipped.</para>

          <para>Similar to step into, but ancillaries are executed at once without
        stepping into them. However, if the user has set a breakpoint in an

        <listitem>
          <para>Scilab executes instructions until the function returns from the
        current context, i.e. the next stop occurs just after the current
        function has returned. However, if the user has set a breakpoint in
        the current function or in an ancillary, Scilab will nevertheless stop
        at this breakpoint. Lines with no executable code (blank or commented
        lines) are skipped.</para>

        <term>Run execution up to the cursor position.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Scilab executes instructions until the cursor position is reached.
        If the user has set breakpoints in the current function or in an
        ancillary, Scilab will skip them and stop only when the cursor
        position is reached. Lines with no executable code (blank or commented
        lines) are also skipped: if the cursor is in such a line, Scilab will
        stop just before executing the next line carrying executable
        code.</para>

    </variablelist>
    <para>When one of the commands above is triggered for the first time, Scipad
    launches execution, i.e. it execs the currently displayed buffer as well
    as all the opened buffers that contain functions, sends to Scilab the
    <link linkend="setbpt">setbpt</link> instructions relative to all the breakpoints that have
    been set, and executes the selected function with the input variable
    values provided during the configure execution step. Then the execution is
    automagically stopped by Scilab according to the debug command that was
    launched. A new debug command can then be executed.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>At any time during the debug, a <emphasis role="bold">watch window</emphasis> can be displayed
    on user request. It allows to monitor any variable value, or change a
    variable value during a breakpoint stop and relaunch execution with the
    modified value. A watchable variable can be part of a larger structure,
    for instance if A is a 20x20 matrix, the shorter sub-matrix A(2:4,7:9)
    can be watched. The watch window also displays the calling stack and
    contains a toolbar with the most useful commands from the debug menu.</para>
    <para/>
    <para>In its current development state the debugger works well with
    functions, i.e. <emphasis role="bold">pure .sci files</emphasis>. Support of .sce files or mixed
    .sce/.sci files is implemented but should be considered as a beta
    functionality. Debug of .sce or mixed .sce/sci files makes use of the
    implementation for the .sci case after having wrapped the code in a
    function/endfunction clause.</para>

          <para>Scipad menues and messages can be translated to several languages.
        By default they appear in English, but other languages
        are being added. The localization in effect can be selected with the
        menu Options/Locale, and is remembered across sessions. Currently, the
        supported languages are: "da" (Danish), "de" (German) ,"eng" (English),
        "es" (Spanish), "fr" (French), "it" (Italian), "no" (Norwegian), "pl"
        (Polish), "se" (Swedish), "zh_tw" (Chinese-Taiwan).</para>

          <para/>
          <para>DnD has been implemented in Scipad for moving around text, for
        dropping selected text from and to external applications, and for
        opening a file or a list of files.</para>
          <para>Dragging one or more files from an explorer and dropping to Scipad
        will open the file(s) in Scipad. Doing the same with a directory will
        open recursively all the directory contents (beware!)</para>
          <para>For text selected within the Scipad window, the possible actions
        are move (just use mouse button-1) and copy (Control button-1). Text
        selections can be moved or copied also between different Scipad
        subpanes, when tiling is active.</para>
          <para>Drag and drop capabilities in Scipad rely on the TkDnD package
        (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdnd). Presence of this package
        should be automatically detected by Scipad, enabling the corresponding
        features at that time. Windows and linux-i386 binary versions of
        Scilab are currently shipped with TkDnD. If not, here are some
        installation instructions:</para>
          <para>Windows platforms: Download the full package (currently
        tkdnd-1.0a2.tar.gz), and uncompress it somewhere. Copy the content of
        lib\tkdnd and paste it into <literal>SCI\modules\tclsci\tcl\tk8.4\tkdnd</literal>.
        That's all!</para>
          <para>linux-i386 platforms: Download the rpm package (currently
        tkdnd-1.0-b2.i386.rpm). Install it with rpm -U (may have to force
        --nodeps if it doesn't recognize an existing Tcl installation). If you
        have a source version of Scilab and an installation of Tcl/Tk, check
        where they are installed (e.g. <literal>/usr/share/</literal>) and move the newly created
        directory <literal>/usr/lib/tkdnd1.0/</literal> to there. If you have a binary version of
        Scilab, move <literal>tkdnd1.0/</literal> to <literal>SCI/modules/tclsci/tcl/</literal>, where the supplied
        Tcl/Tk binaries are.</para>

          <para>Currently Scilab is shipped with Tcl/Tk 8.4. However, Scipad
        offers a handful of quite handy features that are available as soon
        as Tcl/Tk 8.5 is running in its background. For instance, peer text
        widgets are available from Tk 8.5, and this capability is used in
        Scipad to allow for displaying more than one contiguous area of an
        opened file at a time in tile mode. Instructions about how to upgrade
        to Tcl/Tk 8.5 can be found on the Scilab wiki:
