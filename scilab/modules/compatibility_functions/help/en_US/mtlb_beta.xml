        <para>
            Matlab and Scilab <literal>beta</literal> behave differently in some particular cases:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With inputs having different sizes: Matlab <literal>beta</literal> input parameters must have
                    the same size unless one of them is a scalar. In Scilab <literal>beta</literal> input parameters
                    must have the same size even if one of them is a scalar.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_beta(A,B)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>beta(A,B)</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_beta</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>A</literal> is a scalar but not <literal>B</literal>
                    <literal>Y = mtlb_beta(A,B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>C=B;C(:)=A;Y = mtlb_beta(C,B);</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>B</literal> is a scalar but not <literal>A</literal>
                    <literal>Y = mtlb_beta(A,B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>C=A;C(:)=B;Y = mtlb_beta(A,C);</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_beta</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
            </warning>
