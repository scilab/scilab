        <para>
            Matlab and Scilab insertion behave differently for strings due to the fact
            that they do not consider character strings in the same way.
        </para>
        <para>
            The function <literal>str = mtlb_is(sto,sfrom,i,j)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace insertion operations for character strings. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. There is no replacement possibility for it.
        </para>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_is</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
