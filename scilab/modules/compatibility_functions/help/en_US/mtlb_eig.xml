  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_eig">Matlab eig emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>
    
    <P>Matlab <VERB>eig</VERB> and Scilab <VERB>spec</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
	With one input (A) and two outputs (V,D), Matlab and Scilab returned eigen values have opposite signs.
         </SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>[V,D] = mtlb_eig(A)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>>[V,D] = eig(A)</VERB>.
    This function will determine the correct semantic at run time. There is no replacement possibility for it.
    </P>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_eig</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
