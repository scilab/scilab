        <para>Matlab and Scilab insertion behave differently in some particular cases:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When inserting a matrix in a variable: Matlab automatically adjusts output
                    variable to fit with matrix to insert but not Scilab.
                    For example, with A=1, A([1,2,3,4])=[1,2;3,4]) returns an error in Scilab
                    while in Matlab we get A=[1,2,3,4]. If values miss comparing to indexes,
                    Matlab fills output value with 0.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When inserting data into a character string matrix: due to the fact that character string matrices
                    in Matlab can be addressed as any other matrix (each character can be addressed), insertion in such a type of
                    matrix does not differ from other. But in Scilab it can't be done so...<literal>mtlb_is</literal> is an alternative.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>A=mtlb_i(A,k,B)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>A(k)=B</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_i</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>A</literal> is not a vector
                    <literal>A=mtlb_i(A,k,B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A(k)=B</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> are both row or column vectors
                    <literal>A=mtlb_i(A,k,B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A(k)=B</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_i</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
