            There is no Scilab equivalent for Matlab <literal>findstr</literal>.

            The function <literal>mtlb_findstr(A,B)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>findstr(A,B)</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the operands/inputs[CUSTOM] while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_findstr</literal> calls:

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>A</literal> is always longer than <literal>B</literal>
                    (i.e. <literal>findstr</literal> can be replaced by <literal>strfind</literal> in Matlab,
                    <literal>mtlb_findstr(A,B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>strindex(A,B)</literal>

            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_findstr</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
