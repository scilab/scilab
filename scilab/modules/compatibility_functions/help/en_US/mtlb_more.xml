  <SHORT_DESCRIPTION name="mtlb_more">Matlab more emulation function</SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

  <DESCRIPTION>

    <P>Matlab <VERB>more</VERB> and Scilab <VERB>lines</VERB> behave differently in some particular cases:</P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        With character strings as input: Matlab <VERB>more</VERB> can take &quot;on&quot; 
	and &quot;off&quot; as input but not Scilab <VERB>lines</VERB> but there are equivalents (0 and 60).
        </SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>
    The function <VERB>mtlb_more(in)</VERB> is used by
    <VERB>mfile2sci</VERB> to replace <VERB>more(in)</VERB> when it was not
    possible to know what was the input while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
    determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
    more efficient code it is possible to replace <VERB>mtlb_more</VERB> calls:
    </P>

    <DESCRIPTION_INDENT>
    <DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    <ITEMIZE>
      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>in</VERB> is equal to &quot;on&quot;
        <VERB>mtlb_more(in)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>lines(60)</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>in</VERB> is equal to &quot;off&quot;
        <VERB>mtlb_more(in)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>lines(0)</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>

      <ITEM>
        <SP>
        If <VERB>in</VERB> is a double value
        <VERB>mtlb_more(in)</VERB> may be replaced by <VERB>lines(in)</VERB>
        </SP>
      </ITEM>
    </ITEMIZE>
    </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>
    </DESCRIPTION_INDENT>

    <P>Caution: <VERB>mtlb_more</VERB> has not to be used for hand coded functions.</P>
