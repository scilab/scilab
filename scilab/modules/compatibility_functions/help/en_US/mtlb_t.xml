        <para>Matlab and Scilab transposition behave differently in some particular cases:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With character strings operands: The <literal>'</literal> operator is used to transpose whole
                    character strings in Scilab while Matlab realizes the transposition of each character.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_t(A)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>A'</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the operands while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_t</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>A</literal> is not a character string matrix
                    <literal>mtlb_t(A)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>A'</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_t</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
