        <para>
            Matlab and Scilab <literal>find</literal> behave differently in some particular cases:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With column vectors and matrices as input: Matlab <literal>find</literal> returns column
                    vectors while Scilab returns row vectors.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When called with three outputs: Matlab <literal>find</literal> can have three outputs but Scilab not.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>[i[,j[,v]]] = mtlb_find(B)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>[i[,j[,v]]] = find(B)</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what was the input while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_find</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When called with one output, if <literal>B</literal> is a row vector
                    <literal>i = mtlb_find(B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>i = find(B)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When called with one output, if <literal>B</literal> is not a row vector
                    <literal>i = mtlb_find(B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>i = matrix(find(B),-1,1)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When called with two outputs, if <literal>B</literal> is a row vector
                    <literal>[i,j] = mtlb_find(B)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>[i,j] = find(B)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When called with two outputs, if <literal>B</literal> is not a row vector
                    <literal>[i,j] = mtlb_find(B)</literal> may be replaced by
                    <literal>[i,j] = find(B);i = matrix(i,-1,1);j = matrix(j,-1,1);</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_find</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
