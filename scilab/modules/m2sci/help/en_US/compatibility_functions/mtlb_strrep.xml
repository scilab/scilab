        <para>
            Matlab <literal>strrep</literal> and Scilab <literal>strsubst</literal> behave differently in some particular cases:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    With inputs which not character strings: Matlab <literal>strrep</literal> can be used
                    with not character strings inputs but not Scilab <literal>strsubst</literal>.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_strrep(A,B,C)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>strrep(A,B,C)</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what were the inputs while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_strrep</literal> calls:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If <literal>A</literal>, <literal>B</literal> and <literal>C</literal> are character strings
                    <literal>mtlb_strrep(A,B,C)</literal> may be replaced by <literal>strsubst(A,B,C)</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            <warning>
                Caution: <literal>mtlb_strrep</literal> has not to be used for hand coded functions.
            </warning>
