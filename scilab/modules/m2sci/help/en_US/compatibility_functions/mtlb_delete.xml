        <para>
            The function <literal>mtlb_delete(A)</literal> is used by
            <literal>mfile2sci</literal> to replace <literal>delete(A)</literal> when it was not
            possible to know what was the input while porting Matlab code to Scilab. This function will
            determine the correct semantic at run time. If you want to have a
            more efficient code it is possible to replace <literal>mtlb_delete</literal> calls:
