        <para>
            The <literal>TMPDIR</literal> constant holds the temporary directory
            absolute path of a Scilab process. Each Scilab process has its own
            temporary directory, created and referenced to <literal>TMPDIR</literal>
            during Scilab startup. The temporary directory is deleted when Scilab
            stops.
        </para>
        <para>The temporary directories are created as subdirectories of the
            system temporary directory and named SCI_TMP_&lt;unique&gt; where
            &lt;unique&gt; is some number generated at Scilab startup for the name to
            be unique. Under GNU/Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X, directory access rights are
            limited to the Scilab user.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <literal>TMPDIR</literal> constant cannot be altered during
            Scilab execution. However, under GNU/Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X, the system
            temporary directory (usually <literal>/tmp</literal>) can be selected by
            altering the <literal>TMPDIR</literal> system variable.
