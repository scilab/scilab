  <DESCRIPTION>
    <P><VERB>mgetl</VERB> function allows to read a lines from an ascii file.</P>
    <P>
    If <VERB>m</VERB> is
    omitted or is <VERB>-1</VERB> all lines till end of file occurs are read.</P>
    <P>
    If <VERB>m</VERB> is given <VERB>mgetl</VERB> tries to read exactly m lines. This
    option is useful to sequentialy read part of a file. In this case if
    an end of file (EOF) occurs before <VERB>m</VERB> lines are read the read lines are
    returned (it is possible to check if EOF had occured using the meof
    function) issued.</P>
    <P><VERB>mgetl</VERB> allows to read files coming from Unix, Windows, or Mac
    operating systems.</P>
