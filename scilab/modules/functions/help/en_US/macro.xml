            Macros are Scilab procedures ("macro", "function" and "procedure"
            have the save meaning). Usually, they are defined 
            in files with an editor and loaded into Scilab by <literal>exec</literal> or through
            a library.
        </para>
        <para>
            They can also be defined on-line (see <literal>deff</literal>). 
            A file which contains a macro must begin as follows:
        </para>
        <programlisting><![CDATA[ 
function [y1,...,yn]=foo(x1,...,xm)
 ]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            The <literal>yi</literal> are output variables calculated as functions of
            input variables and variables existing in Scilab
            when the macro is executed.
            A macro can be compiled for faster execution. Collections
            of macros can be collected in libraries.
            Macros which begin with <literal>%</literal> sign (e.g. <literal>%foo</literal>) and whose
            arguments are lists are used to perform specific 
            operations: for example, <literal>z=%rmr(x,y)</literal> is equivalent
            to <literal>z=x*y</literal> when <literal>x</literal> and <literal>z</literal> are rationals 
            (i.e. <literal>x=list('r',n,d,[])</literal> with <literal>n</literal> and <literal>d</literal> polynomials).
