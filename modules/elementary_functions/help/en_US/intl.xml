    <P>
    If <VERB>f</VERB> is a complex-valued function, <VERB>intl(a,b,z0,r,f)</VERB> computes
    the integral of <VERB>f(z)dz</VERB> along the curve
    in the complex plane defined by <VERB>z0 + r.exp(%i*t)</VERB> for
    <VERB>a&lt;=t&lt;=b</VERB> .(part of the circle with center <VERB>z0</VERB> and radius <VERB>r</VERB>
    with phase between <VERB>a</VERB> and <VERB>b</VERB>)</P>
